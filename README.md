# SMS-Spam-Detector
Part of a series of projects to attain my Machine Learning certification in Python. See Following: https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jessekullar/machine-learning-with-python-v7

This code accurately detects if a message can be considered SPAM or from a real person ('ham). This model uses LSTM. Currently this model is highly accurate in determining the legitimacy of texts, however each epoch takes a while to run. Could be improved further in the future.
